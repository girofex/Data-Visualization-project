                <p>A war in 2025 and in Europe seemed something out of a dystopic novel, but here we are.<br>
                    The minds of humanity are still corrupted and we don't seem to be learning from the past.<br>
                    The Russo-Ukranian War is the perfect example of how progress is still in the hands of the powerful.

            <h2 id="invasion" data-title="Invasion progression">Invasion progression</h2>
            <p>With the <b>Crimean occupation</b> in 2014, the tension between Russia and Ukraine started to concretize:
                in 2022 this cold-shoulder became a war, that has been progressing since.<br>
                Everyday, the Russians are trying to push the boundaries and conquer more and more areas of Ukraine.<br>
                We observe how their advance is progressing.
                <br><br>
                The plot represents the possession of all Ukraine territories between 2022 and 2024.<br>
                Before the 2022 Russian invasion, Moscow controlled less than 10% of the Ukrainian land,
                as expected after the Crimean dispute.<br>
                After the occupation of February, Russia assumed control of more than one fifth of Ukraine, reaching a peak of 22%.<br>
                The data shows that, in almost three years, Russia maintained the possession of around 20% of Ukrainian territory.<br>
                It's scary to think that in <i>normal</i> conditions the plot should present only the green color, as the totality
                of Ukraine should be under Ukrainians' possession.

            <p>This conflict is near us, both from a geographical and economic point of view, and we know very well how
                <i>everything revolves around interests</i>.<br>
                One of the main topics of discussion was not centered around the health and
                welfare of the populations directly involved,
                but around the possibility of a Russian block to our natural gas supply.<br>
                As war progressed, the EU had to reinvent its strategy in terms of importing the supplies, and it had to
                readjust to new partners.
                <br><br>
                We take a look at how our dependency on Russian resources changed during the previous years.

            <p>At the end, there's always money on the table.<br>
                The EU knew that Russia wasn't a trustable partner, but it still kept the agreements because it was <i>convenient</i>.<br>
                Now, fate made us choose between helping Ukraine and saving the economy or continuing depending on Russia and agree with the wrong side of the history.<br>
                Thankfully, this time, being the good guy and choosing what's best for us seems to align.
