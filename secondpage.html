                <p>The Middle Eastern region has often been an area of great conflict: the populations are heavily
                    divided and, as always, a lot of Western interests are involved.<br>
                    The Israeli-Palestinian situation has been around since the birth of the Israel state, but
                    it became more public only recently because of the start of the genocide.

            <p>To better understand how the situation became what it is now, we have to take a step back
                and look at the history of the modern Middle East.<br>
                The least familiar with history would be surprised to know that the horrors of today's war
                are simply the consequence of decades of abuses and errors.
                <br><br>
                We present a timeline of the main events with corresponding explanation.

                A focus of the history of Middle East has to be on the occupied territory of Palestine.<br>
                After World War II, the UN was entrusted with the difficult task of helping the Jews scattered around the world finding a new place to live.<br>
                The decision was to give them the <b>Promised Land</b>, <b>Palestine</b>, as God said to Abraham and Moses.<br>
                They didn't take into account the fact that during the 3000 years that passed another population built its nation on that land.
                <br><br>
                This error is one of the causes of what is happening: in the end, this results in many deaths, on both parties involved.

                The numbers in the plot are scary, and they are only until December 2024.<br>
                We can note that the majority of deaths is from the filo-palestinian armed groups, such as Hamas, 
                while the least casualties are recorded on the Israeli's government side.<br>
                However, a very high number of civilians, without differentiating between their nationality,
                are affected.<br>
                We can still speculate that, since the majority of the attacks and clashes took place in Gaza and West Bank,
                a great number of these casualties could be Palestinians.<br>
                Hamas was the first one to strike, but as the experts state, it doesn't represent Palestine as it's a
                terrorist group.<br>
                So, beside the fact that it was the first one to strike, Netanyahu's response has been
                very much criticized for being reckless and for not avoiding the involvement of civilians.
                <br><br>
                This leaves us with a sad conclusion: this is not a <i>simple</i> war, we are seeing a <b>genocide</b>.
