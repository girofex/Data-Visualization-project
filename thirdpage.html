                <p>The Drug War is a global campaign that aims to reduce the drug trade while also
                    battling against government corruption.<br>
                    The problem is that the actual abolition of drugs is not on everyone's interest: there are some
                    entities that prefer the situation as it is.

            <p>Our paper in the first pages narrated of <i>stereotypical</i> wars, with soldiers, territorial invasions
                etc.<br>
                In this case, however, we define this War as a <b>Not-War</b>: the battle itself is against an inanimate
                entity,
                which is protected by humans.
                <br><br>
                The media narration exploded with the advent of Pablo Escobar and the Medellín Cartel: the Colombian
                drug lord monopolized
                the cocaine trade into the US in the 1980s and by his death he had an estimated net worth of $30
                billion.<br>
                Its convictions were drug trade, assassinations, bombing, bribery, racketeering and murder.<br>
                However, like in any self-respecting criminal <i>family</i>, he needed the approval of the people to keep its
                monopoly:
                he sponsored social projects and charity to elevate its image.<br>
                He also helped in the constructions of houses, clinics, sport camps in the barrios for poor people, and
                this gave him
                one of his nicknames: <b>Paisa Robin Hood</b>.<br>
                Of course, this is nothing with respect to the circa 4,000 direct deaths he caused, including 600 police
                officers, and many other indirect deaths caused by the drug use.<br>
                In the end it was all about <i>Plata o Plomo</i>, silver or lead: given the magnitude of the Medellín
                Cartel and its allies (like Los Priscos), it's not that difficult to
                understand why many people chose plata and kept quiet.

            <p>After his death and spectacularization with the tv series <i>Narcos</i>, we don't have a <i>big name</i> like Escobar to blame anymore,
                but his legacy lives in his successors.<br>
                Many people approve of his ways and plan on continuing his vision.
                <br><br>
                The world is still under the charming effect of narcotic substances, even more now that new drugs
                are being developed.<br>
                Unfortunately, since 2000 up to 2021, the death rate due to drug disorders doesn't seem to stop
                and it's instead increasing.

            <p>When this article was ideated, the news didn't talk much about the Drug War.<br>
                But, at the time this article was written, Donald Trump actuated the Operation Southern Spear
                and arrested Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro, accusing him of being involved in drug trafficking.<br>
                Beside Maduro's dictatorial regime, Trump in fact <i>kidnapped</i>
                the head of another state, and pushed the narration of a perfect
                operation, with no American casualties.<br>
                However, the reality is different: there were multiple Venezuelan civilians deaths and 115 people
                were killed in the US strikes against boats that have been <i>allegedly</i> smuggling drugs into the USA:
                experts have also questioned the legality of those strikes.<br>
                In the end, this wasn't the perfect operation as it seemed, but Trump's motto seems to be
                <i>"Better safe than sorry"</i>.<br>
                <b>Does the end always justify the means?</b>
                <br><br>
                Even if Trump's intention is to overthrow a dictatorial government and end
                the drug war, is it really his main objective?<br>
                Or is it the fact that Venezuela is the main producer of oil and petroleum of the world and it has
                strong relationships with Russia and China?<br>
                At the end, this Not-War behaves similarly as a normal War: the powerful ones take decisions without
                considering the people and there's always money as the main conductor.<br>
