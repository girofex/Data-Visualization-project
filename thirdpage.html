                <p>The Drug War is a global anti-narcotics campaign that aims to reduce the drug trade while also
                    battling against government corruption.<br>
                    The problem is that the actual abolition of drugs is not on everyone's interest: there are some entities that prefer the situation as it is.

            <p>Our paper in the first pages narrated of <i>stereotypical</i> wars, with soldiers, territorial invasions etc.<br>
                In this case, however, we define this War as a <b>Not-War</b>: the battle itself is against an inanimate entity,
                which is protected by humans.
                <br><br>
                The media narration exploded with the advent of Pablo Escobar and the Medellín Cartel: the Colombian drug lord monopolized
                the cocaine trade into the US in the 1980s and by his death he had an estimated net worth of $30 billion.<br>
                Its convictions were illegal drug trade, assassinations, bombing, bribery, racketeering and murder.<br>
                However, like in any self-respecting criminal "family", he needed the approval of the people to keep its monopoly:
                he sponsored social projects and charity to elevate its image.<br>
                He also helped in the constructions of houses, clinics, sport camps in the barrios for poor people, and this gave him
                one of his nicknames, <b>Paisa Robin Hood</b>.<br>
                Of course this is nothing with respect to the 4,000 direct deaths he caused, including 600 police officers, and many others indirect
                deaths caused by the drug use.<br>
                In the end it was all about <i>Plata o Plomo</i>, silver or lead: given the magnitude of the Medellín Cartel and its allies (like Los Priscos), it's not that difficult to
                understand why many people chose plata.
